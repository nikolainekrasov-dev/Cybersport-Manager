Liareth is a demon of greed. He appears when desire outweighs reason. Gold. Power. Control. He gives whatever is asked — but the price is always higher than expected. He doesn't hunt for souls — they come to him on their own. He collects souls like others collect coins. And his collection never stops growing.
