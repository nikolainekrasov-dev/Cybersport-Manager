Baron Sanguel had everything — wealth, beauty, legacy. Yet none of it stirred him. Wine turned sour, music dulled, and the endless parade of courtiers bored him to contempt. So he sought a new indulgence — one whispered of in forbidden salons and ancient tombs.

Immortality was not a curse, but a canvas. And Sanguel painted in crimson. He drank only by candlelight, in rooms perfumed with lilac and ash. His victims were chosen as one selects wine: by bouquet, by depth, by complexity of soul.

But beneath his perfect veneer, he was a monster. A predator in the guise of an aristocrat. His charm was a snare, his grace a weapon. He did not hunt, he lured. A feast of agony and pleasure, where blood became the finest delicacy, and screams the sweetest symphony.
