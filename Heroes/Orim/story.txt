A quiet village at the edge of the forest — too small to be remembered, too remote to be warned. The demon came after sunset and left nothing but ash.
He should have died. But the paladins of the Solar Order found him — a frightened child with a broken lantern. They took him in — not to forge him into a weapon, but to protect and guide him.
He grew up within stone halls and sunlit galleries. Sweeping floors, lighting candles, copying sacred texts by hand. He spoke little, but listened closely. He studied rites of healing, drew protective wards, delivered food and salves to the wounded. Years passed. He became a monk of the Order.
Now Orim walks where villages lie in ashes after demon raids.
He does not fight — he helps those who survive.
