Blim doesn’t fight for kingdoms, money, or ideals. He fights because nothing compares to a good explosion.

Self-taught and fearless, he builds every bomb by hand — packed with custom charges, triggers, and just the right amount of overkill. He tests them live. Always.

He doesn’t care where the front line is, who sets the laws, or if there’s a plan at all. If something needs to blow up — Blim will make it happen. Loud, fast, and without regard for the consequences.

Wherever he goes, the ground shakes. Enemies vanish. And sometimes... so do allies. But that’s demolition.
