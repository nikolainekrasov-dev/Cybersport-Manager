Darian follows a path marked by blood, guided by the will of the Blood God. Every sacrifice feeds the hunger of his dark master and brings the world closer to a terrible awakening.

He believes that when enough blood is spilled, the god will no longer speak through dreams and signs â€” he will descend into the mortal world in physical form. Darian kills not for conquest, but to open the gate for his god with blood.

He does not hesitate or ask questions. He does what must be done. And no one who stands in his path leaves it alive.
