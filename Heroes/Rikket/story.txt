No one took Rikket seriously. A goblin dreaming of knighthood? They laughed - until he vanished into the scrapyards, muttering about “honor” and “steel.”

Years passed. Then, he returned - taller, louder, and wrapped in a roaring exoskeleton built from rusted armor plates, boiler tubing, and repurposed machinery. The thing groaned and sparked, held together with rivets.

But Rikket stands tall. He bows before battle, recites oaths, and fights with methodical grace. Beneath the smoke and metal beats the heart of a true knight - stubborn, battered, and unshakable.
