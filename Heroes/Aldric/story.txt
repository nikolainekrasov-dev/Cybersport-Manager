Sir Aldric had once led an elite band of knights — the Order of the Dawn. Together, they fought under the banner of light, purging the darkness wherever it lurked.

But in one fateful battle, everything changed. The enemy struck with ferocity, a shadowborn terror that none could foresee. One by one, Aldric's brothers fell. He fought to his last breath, but when the dust cleared, only he remained.

Now, alone but unbroken, Sir Aldric bears the weight of his fallen comrades. His hammer still glows with the light of the sun, a symbol of the Order’s hope, and he will carry it forward — until the light is no more.
