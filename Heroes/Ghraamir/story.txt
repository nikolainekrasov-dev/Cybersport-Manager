No one remembers when he first appeared. The oldest trees recall no time when the marshes didn’t whisper his name. Gramir is neither beast nor god — he is the dream of the swamp itself, a body woven from moss and rot, echoing with the memories of the drowned, the groans of the decayed, and the murmurs of dead waters.

He was once a guardian spirit of the forest, the binding will of swamp life. But over the centuries, as he absorbed fear, blood, and curses, he forgot his name and became what he is now — an eternal shadow wandering the soggy earth.

He does not speak. He watches. His movement is like the shifting of muck, silent and unseen. His touch is like the slow realization of death. The swamp blooms with rot where he treads. No one calls to him — but he comes when the mire itself calls.
