Noctis was born where light is a luxury and safety is an illusion. He knew no heroes. No family. Only streets where those who can disappear before they are noticed survive.

He was not a mage. He was not a warrior. Just a man with a cool head and quiet steps. But one day he realized: shadow is not just a shelter. It is a tool. And if you learn to understand it, it can become a weapon.

He collected shadow magic piece by piece - in basements, on black markets, from those who traded strength for life. He paid everything he had. Even more.
