Qadin was once a respected alchemist, celebrated for innovations in medicine and industry. But ambition turned him toward a darker path.

He began crafting forbidden formulas — poisons without trace, drugs to break the mind, and compounds that reshaped flesh. These were not cures, but weapons.

As his influence grew, Qadin built a criminal syndicate on alchemy. He supplied the black market, commanded killers and smugglers, and ruled from the shadows through fear and precision.

Now, Qadin is both genius and criminal mastermind. The justice hunts him, but he stays one step ahead — his creations securing a power no one dares challenge.
