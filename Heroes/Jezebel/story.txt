Once, she served the Light, healing the wounded and the weary. But her power waned, and Jezebel turned to the forbidden — necromancy. Not for dominion, nor for darkness — only to heal without limits, drawing upon the essence of life and death.

The Church called it heresy. Branded a traitor, she was bound for the pyre. But in that final moment, the power she had once denied became her salvation. Embracing pain, she broke her chains and vanished into the shadows.

Now, Jezebel is neither angel nor demon. She walks the line of balance — stealing strength from foes, gifting it to allies. Those who cast her out will suffer. Those who embrace her will find a shield stronger than death.
