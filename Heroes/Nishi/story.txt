Born at the edge of the enchanted forest of Letharil, Nishi is the daughter of a human healer and a forest spirit of the gazellekin. With swift limbs, straight horns, and a gaze that sees beyond the surface, she walks between two worlds - never fully human, never fully wild.

Taught herbs by her mother and magic by the forest, Nishi became a gifted healer. Her touch soothes wounds, her voice calms storms. But the forest that gave her life is withering, and only she can feel its pain.

Now she wanders, healing the broken and listening to whispers in the wind - searching for a way to heal the land itself, and perhaps, find her true place.
