Amaelina does not strike. She waits.

Her power begins as a whisper — a fleeting thought that doesn’t feel foreign. A suggestion that lingers. Doubt where there was certainty. Day after day, her presence grows, unnoticed. The victim thinks they are still choosing. But each decision is no longer born of will… but of her suggestion.

She doesn't break wills — she rewrites them. The soul bends, not because it must... but because it wants to.

No chains. No violence. Just the quiet horror of forgetting you were ever free.
