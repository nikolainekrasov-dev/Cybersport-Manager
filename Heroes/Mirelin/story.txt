As a child, tides rose with her cries, and lakes stilled when she slept. The ocean called her by name - not gently, but with weight and hunger.
She became a healer not because water was gentle, but because she had once seen how destructive it could be.

Her magic listens for pain. It binds wounds, eases breath, cools fever. But beneath every healing touch lies pressure barely held back - waves that could drown, ice that could cut, tides that ache to surge.

Mirelin moves with care, always balancing the will to heal against the danger of release. Her hands save lives - but she never forgets they could end them too.
