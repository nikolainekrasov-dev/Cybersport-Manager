Long ago, a sacred pact was forged between dragons and men — a fragile peace bound by ancient magic and older words. Azrion belongs to the last order sworn to uphold that pact, not through politics… but through the blade.

He does not hunt dragons out of hatred. His task is not vengeance, but justice. When a dragon breaks the ancient oath — Azrion is summoned.

He gives no speeches. He passes no sentence. The broken oath is judgment enough.

His path is lonely, and history rarely remembers his name. But thanks to Azrion, the balance still holds. For now.
