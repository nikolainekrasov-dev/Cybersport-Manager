Once silent and still, the colossus known as Grondhal awoke when miners dug too deep, tearing at roots older than empires. He rose from the earth, a being of stone, with arms like shattered cliffs — rough, unyielding. In his grasp, an uprooted tree became a weapon of ancient wrath.

Grondhal speaks no words. He does not reason. He remembers.

He remembers the forests burned, rivers poisoned, and caves gutted for greed. Now he walks, and where he treads, stone splits and armies scatter. Not out of cruelty — but as justice carved by nature’s own hand.
