Born in the shadow of the Whispering Pines, Orlin grew up close to the wild. Orphaned young, he learned to survive by watching the forest and listening to its silent language. One winter, he found a wounded wolf pup near a frozen stream. Against all odds, he nursed it back to health. The wolf, whom he named Ash, never left his side.

Now, Orlin roams the land as a skilled hunter and tracker, with Ash as his loyal companion. Together, they move like shadows, bound by survival, trust, and an unspoken bond forged in the cold silence of the woods.
