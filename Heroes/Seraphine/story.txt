Seraphine lost everything to the creatures of the night — her family, her home, her future. In blood, she swore revenge.

Her target was clear: Baron Sanguel. A monster in the guise of an aristocrat, he preyed on the living for nothing but the thrill of suffering. For years, he had evaded her, slipping through every trap she set, leaving only his victims behind.

But she was patient. She hunted lesser beasts to hone her skills, always knowing the real hunt awaited. Sanguel was the one she would face — not for justice, but for final retribution.

Baron Sanguel would fall. Or she would.
