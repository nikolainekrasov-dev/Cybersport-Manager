In his youth, Ilyrion studied fire - wild, radiant, and destructive. He believed that true power lay in devastation. But the flames that once fascinated him could not win wars.

On the battlefield, it is air that triumphs. Invisible, relentless, precise - it breaks formations, disrupts plans, and slices open enemy lines to expose their flanks. Ilyrion turned away from fire and embraced the storm. He never looked back.

Now a legendary strategist, he commands with cold precision, as if placing pieces on a board. His army moves as one under the whisper of his magic. Enemy ranks collapse under gales, blinding dust, and blades carried by unseen currents.
