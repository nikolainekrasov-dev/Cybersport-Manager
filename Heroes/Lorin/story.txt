Lorin was a renowned scholar, driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge. He sought the forbidden - the dark realms of the Abyss, places where no mortal should tread. His mind burned with the question: What secrets lay hidden in the void?

For years, he poured over forbidden texts, performing rituals that twisted the very fabric of reality. With each incantation, his body weakened, but the abyss beckoned him closer. One night, he crossed the final threshold and summoned the void itself. It answered.

Now, Lorinâ€™s presence lingers in the dark corners of the world, his voice a silent invitation to those who would dare to seek the forbidden. To follow it is to lose oneself forever.
